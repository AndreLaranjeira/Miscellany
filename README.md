# Miscellany

A repository to house binaries, templates and configurations files that don't warrant an individual repository. All content in this repository is **unlicensed and free to use!**

## Scripts

Scripts are files that can be run from a terminal to execute a set of commands.

The following items are included in this folder:

- `update.sh`: A script to run update commands individually or all at once. With this, you won't have to waste time trying to figure out the right update command syntax or forget to run updates.
- `upgrade_postgresql.sh`: A script to upgrade postgresql to a new major version using `pg_upgrade`. Now you can actually upgrade postgresql with a single command.

## Templates

Templates are files that can be reused across multiple projects, saving you time and effort due to the adoption of good standards.

The following items are included in this folder:

- `makefile`: My personal makefile template originally designed for C/C++, allowing you to automate the compilation and cleanup of multi-file projects.
